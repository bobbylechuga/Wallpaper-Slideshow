# Wallpaper Slideshow
## For Elementary OS

This turns your desktop into a slideshow.
Find help on how to invoke this command by running ./wallpaper_slideshow.sh --help

You can now change the login screen with your desktop. Make sure you have qdbus installed.
If you are using Qt5 the package may be qdbus-qt5.
If you do not want this behavior you can use the --nologin flag.

You can find information in everything you can do [in this article I wrote on Wallpaper Slideshow](https://poisonpacket.wordpress.com/2015/05/19/elementary-os-slideshow-wallpaper-background/).
